## How GetWidget Started?

We are a huge follower of Flutter and using it from a very early stage ever since it was released in the alpha stage in 2017. We used it in various Flutter apps including some enterprise SAAS applications.

Flutter almost has all the widgets available that developers can use in the project but again, we used to develop lots of projects with flutter and hence decided why not develop all the possible widgets that can be reused in any project and speed up the app development.

We are launching our Beta Release in the beginning to develop, to test the library component. Kindly give us your feedback to improve and add more widgets to our library.

## GetWidget Roadmap

We are committed to continuing this library development to make flutter app design & development less time consuming and with a small learning curve too.

Your support and feedback help us to build the best Flutter Open-Source product.
